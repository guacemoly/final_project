# Abstract

Entering the Forbidden West continues with the analyzation of women’s representation in video games and how journalists and gamers respond to this. With the sexist comments made towards Aloy and Ellie Williams, this study analyzes journalists reviews of Horizon Zero Dawn, Horizon Forbidden West, and The Last of Us Part II, to confirm if gendered language and biases exist in reviews of the games, compared to the reviews of gamers. Using WayBack Machine and Voyant, this study reviews social media posts made by the studios of the games and the engagements on them. In conclusion, the study finds that professionally developed articles have less of a negatively biased response to the games compared to gamer responses. 

# Introduction

The role women play in video games has changed drastically over the decades. Most notable and early representations falling under the Damsel in Distress (Princess Peach) or hyper-sexualized protagonists (original renditions of Lara Croft), women’s presence in video games have become increasingly more meaningful; whereas before they were ‘weak’ or cater to the male gaze, now have their own leg to stand on. As for this, the consideration of women as developers and women as gamers has been taken into account, thus creating characters who are three-dimensional and realistic, inside and out. 
	
This second edition of Entering the Forbidden West will investigate how the overwhelmingly positive response to Horizon Forbidden West and its protagonist, Aloy, had a extremely different initial reaction when the first instalment of the series was released. Aloy is one of the few playable female protagonists in AAA video games, making her extremely recognizable and well-renowned amongst gamers in gaming circles. Because of this and her undoubted popularity, her appearance was scrutinized by both gamers and journalists after the 2017 release of Horizon Zero Dawn. This study aims to represent how not only times have changed, but gamers and journalists alike- and if this sudden positivity towards Aloy and the series has anything to do with better gameplay, or a change in morals. To help prove this point about how female protagonists are treated, this study will look at the response to Ellie Williams from The Last of Us Part II. Gamers were ecstatic about the 2016 announcement of the second instalment in the series, and even more excited to play as an older and tougher Ellie, but that positivity abruptly changed the week of the games release. These situations are extremely similar, however show opposite examples of how people go from negative to positive, and positive to negative, and what that has to say about gaming culture as a whole. It is hypothesized that the journalists in their more professional reviews of the games will be more positive and unbiased, compared to gamers.

Using readings from the course such as Uncovering ‘hidden’ contributions to the history of Digital Humanities: the Index Thomisticus’ female keypunch operators by Nyhan and Terras, and The Dark Side of Digital Humanities by Chun, Grusin, Jagoda and Raley, these will provide more insight to representation of women and marginalized people, or the lack thereof, in digital humanities circles, and how in general there are negative and positive connotations associated with this. To come to this conclusion, of if gaming culture has become more in support of women protagonists, will be done using methods of looking to past articles, audience responses, and ratings using digital tools.

# Methodology

This study will use multiple tools to find data related to social media posts and journalists articles. Starting with the WayBack Machine, this will be used to find tweets from 2015 to present by Guerilla Games and Naughty Dog, to find the difference in engagement, and if there was a increase or decrease in retweets, likes, and replies. Since not all information is documented on the Wayback Machine, the reverse search function on Twitter will be used in order to find tweets from a key date, month and/or timeline. To do this, the titles of the games, the characters, and release dates for trailers and the games themselves will be used. Next, this study will use articles from releases of Horizon Zero Dawn and Horizon Forbidden West, and articles from before The Last of Us Part II’s release, versus articles from after its release. These articles will be put into Voyant to analyze adjective use, and see how the language used to discuss these games changes. Specifically, if any gendered language was used, or language to implicate some kind of bias, for or against, the appearances and decisions of Aloy and Ellie, and if there is something to be said about the findings. This study will use graphs and Cirrus maps to visualize the data explored. Using such methods will show the possible ways one can interpret how language is used to describe women-lead video games. 

I. Participants

The participants of study will be Aloy, Ellie, gamers, and journalists responsible for the articles written pre-release and post-release of Horizon Zero Dawn, Horizon Forbidden West, and The Last of Us Part II. It is not possible to divide participants into race and age based categories, but it can be assumed upon hypotheses that many opinions related to the womens appearances would be made by men, however that is upon assumption and not guaranteed at this stage in the study. 

II.  Apparatus and materials 
(All done via a computer)

WayBack Machine
Provided by Internet Archive, the WayBack Machine allows researchers to find archived internet data such as webpages, social media posts, etc. It allows for information from earlier years of the internet to be stored and saved. This will be used to find possible trends from years before the present and Twitter posts by Guerrilla Games and Naughty Dog.

Voyant
Provides meaning for digital texts based upon commonly used adjectives, nouns, verbs etc., where and how they were used, how many times they were used in comparison to one another, and which associations can be made between them. This will allow for the study to analyze if gendered language exists when discussing Aloy and Ellie, and if there are more negative or positive implications made with words used to describe reviews of the games pre-release and post-release.

III. Procedure
There is no specific instruction tasked upon participants since this study is not going to be done with them, rather than, done with the publicly available content made by them. All information needed from the participants was their own article entries and reviews of the games and the characters. The participants are not aware that they are participants, therefore, the procedure mainly requires the apparatus and materials to do their job.

In order, here is how the study will be conducted:

1. Pick two AAA video games with women protagonists
2. Analyze conversations related to said protagonists and the games they lead
3. Find articles, reviews, and responses related to the women prior to the games releases and after, and what possible differences in opinion exist
4. Look for Twitter posts by the developers from 2015-present day via the WayBack Machine 
5. Implement articles found into Voyant and analyze if the language used from the past and present has changed, find what can be implied here
6. Compile data found into graphs and Cirrus maps
7. Analyze the conclusions made based on apparatus and materials

# Results

The beginning of this study considered important dates related to Horizon Zero Dawn, Horizon Forbidden West, and The Last of Us Part II. The dates and their importance are as follows:

Horizon Zero Dawn
First announcement at E3 2015: June 16-18, 2015
E3 2016 trailer release: June 6, 2016
Launch trailer release: February 24, 2017
Full game release: February 28, 2017

Horizon Forbidden West
Announcement trailer: June 11, 2020
State of Play Gamplay reveal: May 27, 2021
Story trailer: January 19, 2022
Full game release: February 18, 2022

The Last of Us Part II
PSX 2016 announcement and teaser trailer: December 3, 2016
E3 2018 Gameplay reveal: June 11, 2018
Release date reveal: September 24, 2019
Full game release: June 19, 2020

Beginning with Guerrilla Games, their activity on Twitter was extremely limited based on archived information via the WayBack Machine. Detailing only four snapshots in the entirety of 2015, only one about Horizon Zero Dawn

![""](./wayback_guerrilla_june12.png)

Most that can be noted with these screenshots is the increase in interest for Guerrilla Games via their following, jumping from 2,032 on June 12th, 2015, to 19.6k in October 21st, 2015. These is also evidence of a fan cosplaying as Aloy, showing a women gamers interest in the character. 2016 showed extremely limited archived information relevant to this study, until February 23rd, 2017, when Guerrilla was hyping the games release.

Skipping ahead to Horizon Forbidden West, an increase in archived Twitter data was evident. Especially interest in Guerrilla and the Horizon series, with twitter engagements reaching the thousands (the option to translate some snapshots was unavailable).

WayBack Machine showed most archived data in 2022. The tweets following the release of the game on the 18th were not too important to the study, but regardless, the obvious growth in interest for Guerrilla and the Horizon series is evident based on the amount of archived data compared to early years.

Compared to Guerrilla Games, Naughty Dog has a significantly larger database of archived Twitter snapshots. Data from an important month to this study (December 2016) is limited, as most archived tweets are related to another game by the studio. Jumping straight to 2018, their tweet for the gameplay reveal received 15k retweets and 33.7k likes.

2019 showed major interest in the launch date reveal.

2020 saw the most interest and engagement.

 Archived Twitter data based on all three games shows unbiased numbers and engagement. Before implementing data into Voyant based on articles, it is important to take note of the types of things gamers and journalists had to say. When the State of Play Gameplay trailer was released in May 2021 for Horizon Forbidden West, many were unhappy with Aloys updated appearance (updated due to graphics and realism to a time skip between games). Originally, it was assumed that her appearance was criticized since the first game, but after reviewing articles, the outrage came about during the announcement of  HFW. This began a conversation about how femininity is presented, and the logistics of feminine traits such as makeup, hair and body types that suit the male gaze. Evidence of this comes from the infamous Tweet that circulated on Twitter, which was mocking Reddit users who were criticizing Aloys updated look (notice the comparison to Ellie):

When analyzing various journalist reviews of the games in Voyant, there was not much evidence to prove the point about possible gender bias or sexist language. This was assumed originally in the hypothesis. When conducting the study, the goal was to avoid confirming biases, and to avoid finding articles that would specifically be negative. Hence, articles from IGN, Kotaku, The Guardian, Review Geek, Game Rant, etc. were chosen. This then lead to taking a look at Metacritic reviews, which are generally made by gamers. When implementing Metacritic review pages of the games into Voyant, it was difficult to narrow down the Cirrus map and remove words that were irrelevant- however, understanding what “review bombing” is and taking it into account is important supplemental information. HFW and TLOU2 all faced review-bombing from gamers after their releases due to reasons such as “woke virtue signalling” (having realistic women characters; Ellie who is a lesbian, Aloy “for having a beard” (peach fuzz)), major character deaths, and a presumed bias based on positive and fair reviews given by professional journalists. 

Horizon Zero Dawn:

 Horizon Forbidden West:

 The Last of Us Part II: 

 ![""](./TLOU2_review_1.png)
 ![""](./TLOU2_review_2.png)
 ![""](./TLOU2_review_3.png)
  
So, what can be taken from this is that journalists were less likely to be offensive in their responses, but rather, if mentioning the issues other gamers had, they would be stated as matter of fact. Looking to Metacritic’s comparison of Critic vs. User reviews, here is what was found:

# Discussion

Ultimately, the goal for both parts of Entering the Forbidden West, was to analyze how gamers and fans respond to the games that they play. The first part hypothesized how gamers would discuss Horizon Forbidden West, ultimately knowing the response would be overwhelmingly positive, due to the excitement over its launch. As a woman who plays video games myself, especially ones with women-led stories, I understand the magnitude of sexism that is present in gaming spaces. I chose to add The Last of Us Part II as an additional example to the study as to this day, two years after the game was released, Ellie is condemned for her sexuality, and way of expressing her femininity. Both Aloy and Ellie live in post-apocalyptic America, and the unfair criticisms they receive are focused entirely on them not catering to the male gaze, or if anything, not catering to men at all. Aloy and Ellie are realistic and important representations to women and girls, and this is understood by the professional reviews of the games, as analyzed by Voyant and myself. 

Reviewing literature such as Nyhan and Terras article, they discuss the ‘hidden’ contributions to the Index Thomisticus. They state in their study that there were many female contributors to the Index Thomisticus that were not acknowledged (Nyhan & Terras,). This is relevant to the study as it cares about the presence of women in male-dominated spaces, especially Digital Humanities spaces. Considering that these women were not credited or seen as valid contributors, despite being the reason the Index Thomisticus exists, this proves how sexism has always existed in the development of technology. Comparing this to The Dark Side of Digital Humanities, Chun, Grusin, Jagoda and Raley, Jagoda discusses the problem of games and gamification. He states “games have touched practically every aspect of contemporary life”- this is true with respect to how ingrained video games are into our culture, and how influential they are to the people who play them. Although this article is about the dark side of DH, this statement is valid from the perspective that video games have become so real. Like mentioned in the Introduction, women’s role in video games has evolved- they are no longer just objects for sex and the male gaze, but rather, are realistic and have their own thoughts and feelings, and look the way real women do. 
	
Overall, I think this study poses many questions that can be answered in future studies that are similar to this- does the bias against women in video games inherently come from an unprofessional standpoint? And should gamers consider where their biases come from, or why they jump to be bigoted when something they dislike happens in a video game that they did not make?

I feel it is important to study this topic right now as video games have become so much more than a niche hobby. They change lives and create safe spaces for people, such as women, to see themselves represented in worlds that are not their own. Understanding the impact these games have, whether discussing the connections they can make via virtual photography and participatory, or the controversial conversations that arise purely from the existence of women as capable protagonists in harsh worlds.
